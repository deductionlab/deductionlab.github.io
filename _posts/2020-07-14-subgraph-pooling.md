# Review of "Improving ... Subgraph Pooling" by Crouse et al. (2020)

## Overview

We understand the architectural contributions of this work to be twofold:

1. In previous works of graph representation-based theorem proving [ADD REFS], relatively little sophistication has been afforded to the process of drawing the final embedding of a graph from the its node embeddings. 
For instance, Paliwal et al. (2019) simply takes the maximum of the node embeddings as the graph's embedding.
